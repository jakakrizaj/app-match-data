This application probably has some bugs and unfinished features. Future improvements are outlined in issues.
Full disclosure - I used chatgpt to get a basic layout of the tkinter GUI (like setting up tabs and plots) and then learned from that to expand more tabs. The bulk of the data processing I wrote myself (and with the rigid transform code from :source: when added)
